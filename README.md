# Log Hardware Info

Tired of asking your users the java flags they use? The memory they have assigned to Minecraft? Or the version of the modpack they are running? Especially when they have no crash reports

Well then, all this will be printed in the logs under the `LogHardwareInfo:` section

Modpack information is taken from the [Better Compatibility Checker](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/better-compatibility-checker) mod by reading the `config/bcc.json` file
